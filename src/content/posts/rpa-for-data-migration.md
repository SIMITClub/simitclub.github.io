Simplifying tedious processes which often require manual work forms the crux
of automation. The idea of automation gained traction in 1946 in the
automobile industry, through which production was sped up and made more
seamless with automated mechanisms.

Over time, automation has evolved to cater to various purposes, across
different industries. As far as the IT industry is concerned, automation has
had and is continuing to aid in increasing efficiency and reducing human
intervention in the areas of software tools, frameworks and deployments. IT
automation streamlines processes such as application deployment and incident
handling through respective software.

The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software has gained more widespread
recognition and users in the past decade as compared to its early stages of
implementation. RPA has helped to automate repetitive tasks which were done
manually previously, leading to increased overall productivity and
efficiency. The software has also proven to ensure data security while
performing the input tasks, making it an ideal solution for data migration.

With the help of RPA, when there is a need to migrate data for a company,
the staff are not required to undergo the stress of gathering information
from multiple systems and transferring them into one location. Instead, they
can adopt the framework of RPA, key in the required details, program some
rules / conditions for the RPA bot to adhere to (which includes but not
limited to: filtering any unwanted data) and proceed with the process.

This will vastly decrease the possibility of a human error occurring in the
data transition, preventing any loss of files or breach of sensitive
information. Another vital benefit would be the time saved for the staff to
focus on other parts of their work, an attribute which applies to other RPA
use cases as well.

However, with these advancements in place, the RPA also has its limitations.
Since the software is designed to receive a structured instruction of what
needs to be done, it will be unable to perform any tasks which have not
already been defined. Thus, while RPA can help to automate manual tasks done
by humans, it will not be able to capture or determine additional tasks
which may need to be performed for further enhancement.

In the case of data migration, the maximum potential RPA could fulfil may be:

1. To follow the instructions and conditions to transfer the required and
   previously declared data.
2. Implement any predefined filters to sieve out unwanted data transfer.

Limitations will emerge when a user would need a task to be performed, but
is unable to do so as the task has not already been defined. An example
would be to remove any duplicate data during the transition; if such a
condition has not been defined to be executed prior to the migration, the
user will experience issues in completing a successful and clean data migration.

A solution to combat this issue would be to combine RPA and Artificial
Intelligence (AI). While RPA will handle the usersâ€™ inputs on the data to be
transferred (base rules and conditions to be fulfilled), AI can optimise the
process by allowing the bots to develop a learning capability and infer on
how to improve the procedure. This is typically referred to as Intelligent
Process Automation (IPA).
