Automation has been with us for a very long time and has always been the 
solution to increased efficiency, reduced errors and risk, improved profits, 
and proper compliance. With the advancement of technologies, Robotic Process 
Automatic (RPA) has been replacing traditional automation.

A few of the differences between RPA and traditional automation are its 
technological use. Traditional automation makes use of Application 
programming interfaces(APIs) which require users to study and understand the 
system well, but RPA uses software bots to understand user actions at a more 
UI-friendly level. In this case, RPA is more convenient regarding technology 
interfaces and uses.

Another difference is the level of customization. RPA offers a high level of 
customization as it has the functionality to create bots that will tend to 
the userâ€™s particular needs. It can integrate with applications like email, 
calendar, Enterprise resource planning (ERP) and Customer relationship 
management (CRM) for data collection and creation of automated responses. 
This will be a challenge for traditional automation due to the limitations 
of APIs.

## Integration of RPA in different industries

So, what kind of opportunities does RPA offer?

The demand for RPA has been growing steadily and due to the pandemic, RPA 
has proven to be efficient for many businesses due to the work-from-home 
strategy, hence the integration of  RPA in their business. This has led to 
an increase in various career opportunities for people with RPA skill sets. 
The job roles that are in demand include RPA developer, RPA Engineer, RPA 
Data analyst, RPA Project Manager, etc. With the increase of technological 
capabilities in years to come, the idea of using automation will be more 
well known.
