## Our Activities

#### LEARN, SHARE, EARN

### Acquire New Skills in Industry Relevant Workshops

> An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.  
> Sir Benjamin Franklin

As members of the IT community, 
SIM IT club could not agree with this statement any more than we already do.

We believe that it is most appropriate to not bound ourselves 
merely to the standards that our courses have set for us. 
To continue exploring the ever-growing landscape of IT, 
we believe it will be the essence of future innovation.

Our upcoming workshops and "mini-workshops" are freely available resources of knowledge  
for those seeking to enrich themselves with all things IT. 
From a full hands-on tutorial session to a quick burst of 5-minute introduction to relevant IT topics, 
the SIM IT Club will continue to provide learners with rich contents.

### Compete for Prizes on Our Hackathons

One of the best ways to garner confidence over your own abilities in the tech industry is to compete against other like-minded individuals. 
And we believe that as students, 
there is no better way to do so than through hackathons.

The SIM IT club aims to create a hackathon environment backed by experts on the field. 
This ensures that competitors can get useful training prior to the start of the event.

In addition to that, experts will ensure that the standard of the submissions will be kept high, 
and that the submissions themselves will be judged fairly.

### Become a Member of The Subcommittee

For individuals looking to participate in a more service-centric manner, 
keep a lookout for our recruitment drive initiative. 
In this annually held event, 
we selectively search for students passionate about helping others connect and excel in the field.

By becoming a member of our subcommittee, 
you will be able to contribute to making the aforementioned events available for the campus community. 
This contribution includes (but is not limited to)

- üì¢ Becoming a speaker for one of our workshops
- üì± Promoting our club events on various social media alongside the marketing team
- ‚úîÔ∏è Making sure the event runs smoothly as part of our events crew.

As for those truly confident in their abilities, 
rest assured that the recruitment drive initiative also looks for executive committee members who can lead the club.
