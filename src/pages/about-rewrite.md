## Our Activities



> An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.  
> Sir Benjamin Franklin

Our upcoming workshops are freely available resources of knowledge  
for those seeking to enrich themselves with all things IT. 
From a full hands-on tutorial session to a quick burst of 5-minute introduction to relevant IT topics, 
the SIM IT Club will continue to provide learners with rich contents.
