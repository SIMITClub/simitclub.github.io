			<h1>SIM IT Club</h1>
			<p>
				Hey there 👋<br />
				We're the SIM Information Technology Club (ITC) — the hangout spot for techies,
				curious minds, and “I’ll-learn-as-I-go” folks. Here, we build cool stuff,
				learn useful things, and just vibe together. ✨
			</p>
			<p>
				Our mission? Keep tech fun, relevant, and useful — no gatekeeping, no
				stress. 🚀
			</p>
			<p>Throughout the year, we run a mix of events and initiatives:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>🧠 Tech talks & seminars with industry experts</li>
				<li>🧪 Hands-on workshops in Web Dev, GitHub, AI, UI/UX & more</li>
				<li>🎉 Hackathons (yes, the fun kind)</li>
			</ul>
