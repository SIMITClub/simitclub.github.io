# 👋 Welcome to SIM IT Club

We’re the SIM Information Technology Club (ITC) — a student-run community where techies, curious minds, and “I’ll-learn-as-I-go” folks gather to build cool stuff, learn useful things, and just vibe together. ✨  

Our mission? **Make tech fun, relevant, and accessible for everyone.**  
No gatekeeping. No stress. Just growth and community. 🚀

Our community is all about curiosity, collaboration, and building cool things together — no matter your background or starting point. 🚀
